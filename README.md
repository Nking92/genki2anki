#genki2anki
This is a script to convert the assets from the
[GENKI Vocab Cards](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.co.japantimes.genkivocab)
Android app into a deck for the [Anki flashcard software](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).
The assets themselves are not included in this repo.
You will have to buy the application and extract them yourself.
